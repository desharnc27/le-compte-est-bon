The definition of "Number of possibilities" used in this project has some fog that we need to clear out. So let's detail our definition below.

We need to define what combinations are considered identical and which ones are considered distinct.

Commutativity: identical

Swapping the two terms of a commutative opertion (+,x) does not change the combinations. x + y and y + x are considered equivalent and thus make for only one possibility.

Associativity: distinct

Modifying the bracketing around three terms combined with two sums or two multiplications produces different possibilities. Hence, (a + b) + c, (a + c) + b, and (c + b) + a are three different combinations.

Identical terms: distinct

In the specific case where the terms contain 2 identical values, they are treated as different terms.

Ex:
java LeCompteEstBon 3,3,7 18

This counts for two possibilites: (3_A * 7) - 3_B and  (3_B * 7) - 3_A, where A and B are used to distinguish the two 3s.

Other specifications:

Possibilities in which a negative number  is created, even temporairly, are not counted (considered as illegal). Ex: ....(5 - 7) + 6... is not ok since 5 - 7 = -2 and we should not have any negative value at any step, even if the next step would immediately remove the negativity.
