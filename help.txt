The first argument should be the 6 terms seperated by comma.

You can also have a second argument (arguments are separated by spaces), which is the target value.

With that second argument, the program will print a way of combining the terms to reach the target value.

Without a second argument, the program will print a way of reaching every possible target value.

In both cases, the program also prints the number of different ways you can reach required target value(s), but without displaying every way in detail.
You can read "counting.txt" for more information on the counting number. 

ex:

java central.LeCompteEstBon 2,4,7,12,17,77 43

output:

77-(17*(12/((7-4)*2)))
=77-(17*(12/(3*2)))
=77-(17*(12/6))
=77-(17*2)
=77-34
=43
Number of possibilities: 1601
